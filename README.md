dedicated resources to advancing the PyPl packagerepository.Shamika Mohanan joined the PSF as Python Packaging Proj-ect Manager in August 2021,fulfilling a key PSF goal for 2021.In thatrole,Shamika has been focused on working closely with the packagingcommunity to identify development apportunities that would improve thepackaging ecosystem.\nAs the first major initiative,Shamika worked with the packaging communi-ty that uses PyPl as a team.By soliciting feedback from the community ina series of three surveys,Shamika has identified prioritized features thatwill add value to PyPI.The surveys highlighted the important role thatPyPi plays in any Python user's workflow and the consensus was generallypositive.The most requested features were namespace support,organi-zation accounts that can manage multiple users and projects,and privatepackages.Another recurring theme in the surveys was a demand for theability to establish provenance of a package,and we hope that name-space support and organization account features will go a long way inserving this community need.The development of these new features willalso create a path for PyPl to become a self-sustained service.The fullsurvey report is gwailghlehere\nWe are grateful to Bloomberg for generously providing the funding forthis role and sponsoring this valuable work.\nPyCon Tanzania,2021-K15

Python SoftwareFoundation.It was also theyear of virtual events,as weorganized a virtual PyConUS and continued supportingvirtual events through theGrants Program.2021 had ushire several new team mem-bers to expand our operations,say farewell to two long-timestaff members,and preparefor an in-person PyCon Us\nin 2022.\nPyCon US is always the biggest happening for the Python Software Foundation,and for a large partof the Python community.Even though PyCon US 2021 had to be virtual for everyone's safety,weworked hard to make it an enjoyable and unique experience,with high-quality talks,tutorials andkeynotes,and virtual meeting spaces for attendees to learn about our sponsors,discover the jobmarket,explore Python projects and meet fellow Python community members.Although the ongoingpandemic did not let us celebrate the PSF's 20th anniversary at PyCon US quite the way we wouldhave wanted,we did make the most of it.We recreated two classic Python T-shirts and offered themas gifts during our Spring Fundraiser,held during PyCon us.\nOur 2Oth anniversary also involved some staffing changes.Betsy Waliszewski,our Sponsorship Coor-dinator,retired from the PSF after many years of being our fundraising and administrative backbone.We strengthened our team with four new members:Olivia Sauls (Event Assistant and AdministrativeSupport),Loren Crary (Director of Resource Development),tukasz Langa(Developer-in-Residence),and Shamika Mohanan(Packaging Project Manager).Last,but not least,was the departure of EwaJodlowska,our Executive Director.Ewa made the PSF what it is today,and we owe her an enormousdebt of gratitude for her many years of exceptional service to the PSF and the Python community.When she decided it was time for her to move on,she took great care to make sure the PSF staff wasin a position to keep everything going.Thomas Wouters,Board Vice Chair and long-time communitymember,stepped up as Interim General Manager to make sure the staff have everything they need,while the Board of Directors continued the search for the next Executive Director.We have now hiredDeb Nicholson as the next Executive Director.\nIn the meantime,the Python Software Foundation continues its work.Even through another year of pan-demic challenges,we are proud we met the 2021 goals set in our 2020 Annual Impact Report,althoughwe will continue to work on diversifying revenue and improving sustainability.We continued supportingthe Python community through grants and fiscal sponsorships,spending more than S117,000 to supportthe global Python community in 41 countries,primarily through virtual events,and we celebrated the ef-forts of 12 community members through Community and Distinguished Service Awards.We also startedpreparations for an in-person PyCon US 2022,taking great care to do so safely and responsibly.\nWe look forward to expanding our operations in the years to come,and 2022 will be about establish-ing the groundwork for this.Shamika and the Packaging Work Group are already working on improve-ments to PyPl to support the community and allow us to diversify income.The new Executive Direc-tor will work with the Board of Directors and the rest of the PSF staff to establish more concretegoals for this year,and we will be keeping the community up to date on the progress.\n\n\nLooking back at20 years of the PSF\nTHO MAS WOUTERS,INTERIM GENERAL MANAGER\nThe Python Software Foundation is twenty years old.As a contributor toPython at the time,I was a founding member,and I was a member of theBoard for the first three years.Even though I kept up with the communityand some of the work the PSF has done over the years,I didn't really see thefull extent of the PSF's growth and impact until I came back to the Boarda few years ago,and especially now that I've taken on the interim GeneralManager role.\nTwenty years ago,the PSF was created to hold the Python copyrights andtrademarks.It was also created to safeguard the language as an open-source project,and with the idea of raising funds to spend on Python and thecommunity.Despite having some experienced people on the Board (not me),most of us didn't really have a good idea of the strategic direction of theFoundation.We didn't know where to go,or how to get there.We did believePython was special and would remain popular,but I do not think any of us\nexpected it to grow to be one of the most popular,most widely-used languagesin the world.\nNow,the PSF is where we could not possibly have hoped for.Python isincredibly popular,all over the world and in all areas of business,scienceand education.We have a thriving,diverse,global community.The PSF hostscritical infrastructure,foremost the Python website and PyPl,the PythonPackaging Index.We have actual staff to run our day-to-day operations,toorganize PyCon US every year,and to provide Fiscal Sponsorship to Pythonprojects and Grants to communities and events all over the world.We noweven have team members to support volunteers working on PyPl and onCPython.\nJust last year the PSF hired tukasz Langa as the PSF's first Develop-er-in-Residence,a full-time developer to work on CPython,directed by thePython Steering Council.We also hired Shamika Mohanan as the PythonPackaging Project Manager,to help us expand PyPI's functionality andmprove sustainability.More on their work later in this report.\nI think it's safe to say the Python Software Foundation could not have beenso successful if it hadn't been for Ewa Jodlowska,who was our ExecutiveDirector until last year,as well as our early staff members,Kurt Kaiser andBetsy Waliszewski.But while they were instrumental in building up the PSFto its current state,they are far from the only ones who helped us get here.The PSF is a collaborative effort by Board members past and present;every-one who worked on Python itself;everyone who worked on Python projects,documentation,events or community resources;and everyone who support-ed the community in some way.It is truly a community accomplishment.\nIt is because of the community support and efforts that the PSF weatheredthe last two years so well,and that we're in a good enough shape to at-tempt an in-person PyCon US for the first time in three years.The PSF hasa solid paid staff to support the volunteer Board of Directors and all thevolunteers who work with us,and we can now make long-term plans andinvestments.The future of Python is looking bright,and we look forward toworking with the global Python community to build it.\n\n\n\r\n"]
